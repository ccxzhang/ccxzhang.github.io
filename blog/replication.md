The replication materials were obtained via the [link](http://doi.org/10.3886/E116339V1) and saved in the `Data` folder of the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ccxzhang/I4R-BLLMZ-AEJ-2015/).

The replication procedures are:
- Run the Stata do file to see if there is any inconsistency between the produced tables and displayed tables in the published journal.
- Follow the same analysis procedures and use python to replication to see if there exists any inconsistencies.
